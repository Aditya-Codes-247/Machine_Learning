# Neural Network Logic Gate Predictor

This repository contains C codes for neural networks designed to predict the outputs of various logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.). These codes are written from scratch without the use of any external libraries. The primary goal is to demonstrate the fundamentals of neural network implementation and training in C.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a simple and educational example of how neural networks can be implemented from the ground up in C. The neural networks in this repository are trained to predict the outputs of basic logic gates based on given inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the codes in this repository, you need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Basic understanding of neural networks and logic gates

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Codes-247/Neural_Network_C.git
cd NeuralNetworkLogicGates
